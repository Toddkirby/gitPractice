the flow ->
Your situation -> ex
Your potential git solution ->

Accidental commit to the wrong branch:
undo the last commit with ->
git reset HEAD~ --soft
git stash
move to correct branch ->
git checkout name-of-correct-branch
git stash pop
git add . # or add <individual files>
git commit -m "fixed commit!"
now the changes are expected on the correct branch!
