git is a client best thought of as a staging area where we
can store our files for pushing to the upstream repo like
github.

where is the git staging area on the current machine?

In technical terms, the staging area is the middle ground
between what you have done to your files
(also known as the working directory) and what you had
last committed (the HEAD commit). As the name implies,
the staging area gives you space to prepare (stage)
the changes that will be reflected on the next commit.

how can you roll back a commit?

to revert a git commit and undo unwanted changes is simple.
all you need to do is git revert <id of commit>
git reflog will give you the id's of what was committed so
you can pinpoint the commit you dont want
if you wish to undo every change since a given commit
occurred, you'd want to issue a hard git reset, not revert.

how to merge with commits in main and your own?
you would first need to git fetch and determine the
merges from main into your own branch then push and do a
PR to get main caught up with your branch.


what sequential order are the merge in main and the divergent branch?
there are different approaches for different usecases:
first: git checkout main to get an idea of the variance between
your branch and main
second: git merge <your branch> this will bring up any merge
conflicts if there are any
third:git add to add the files that were altered during merging
fourth:git commit to create a commit with the files
fifth:git push to finalize the merge.
